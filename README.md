Hello, welcome to my repository. Currently, there is no linux or macOS version, but I will make sure there is.
The latest version is only for windows.
Version 2 is a different WiFi Password Revealer for Windows. It is more advanced and it reveals all WiFi Passowrds found on the system instead of you having to type out the WiFi SSID. Version 2 is better because it gets all WiFi Passwords without you ever typing anything.
